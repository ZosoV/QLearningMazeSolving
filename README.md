# Maze Solving with Q-Learning

### How to use it.

1. Setting the current maze and the target point in the global variables.
2. Compile and execute the algorithm. Use the commands.

Note: the current application is train with a maze 12x12 and the learning weigths are stored in the file
```learning.txt```

### Commands of the algorithm

The interface has some commands to execute the code.

Command  | Use
-------- | ------------
```p```  | Stop and Continue
```2```  | Load the learning
```3```  | Train the agent
```4```  | Store the learning and stop the training
```5```  | Set the initial position of the agent. (First stop the algorithm and then use this command). Click two times.
```6```  | The agent use the learning to find the target position. If you want to pause the moving use ```6``` again.
```7```  | First pause with ```6```, then click to do slowly or fastly (here you can also set a new initial position with ```5```) , and run again ```6```.
